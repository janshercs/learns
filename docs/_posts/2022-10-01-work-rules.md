# Introduction

Pretty awesome book, easy to read. Book is mainly about how to create a workplace that is enjoyed by all employees. More of a HR book than SWE one but I think it's great for everyone and anyone who is thinking of assuming a leadership position (anyone that wishes to be a force multiplier and have influence beyond themselves).

# Learning points

## Trust and Transparency

- Trust that people are good.
  - If there is anything to take away from this book, it is this. Most people that you work with are good and that they want to do their best.
  - Trusting that people are good will allow you to micromanage less and at the same time allow everyone to live up to their potential!
- Share as much information with the people as you can: having transparency makes people accountable for their results and motivates everyone to do better.
- With the knowledge that your decisions and the following results need to be shared, there will also be more thought put into collecting data (see SRE book post for more information about data collection)

## Behaviour changes

- Nudges to encourage people; make it easy for them to do the things you want them to do.

## Decision making

> If there's data for decision making, we'll use the data; if there's only opinions, we're going to go with mine.

- Always aim to collect and use data for your decision (very consistent with the way Google does things; see the SRE book post.)
- Wisdom of the Crowd; there is always some form of personal biasness: it is important for everyone to recognise that BEFORE making a decision or partaking in a decision making process
- Even after being aware of the biasness, it is best to take in opinions of multiple parties as it has been shown that the decisions after calibration of multiple parties are more accurate than the average of one person alone.
  - i.e. you can perform above average a few times, but not all the time (kind of how most prop traders can't outperform the market ALL the time)

## Work Performance

- It's easier to recruit good performers v.s. training up poor performers to become good ones
- Performance at work follows a Pareto distribtution rather than a normal distribution; the mean will be higher than the median; strive to be the top 10% of performers doing 90% of the work! (I believe it's technically 80/20, but hey! you get the idea!)
- Separating performance and reward conversations; while they are (and should) be definitely correlated, it helps to separate these conversations, why?
  - Makes the relationship between performance & compensation less transactional;
  - As people are good, they intrinsically do wish to perform to their best abilities; by having reward compensations together with performance ones, they begin to conflate the 2 issues and start to place limits on themselves (I'm not paid enough to do this job better)

## Training

- You learn the best when you learn the least: focused practice.
- Leverage on your own experts; there are tons of experts in your organization, use them to raise the bar!
  - If your expert spends 10% of their time making everyone 10% better, the increased productivity will more than compensate for the 10% expert time spent; talk about scalability!

# Closing thoughts

> Any idea carried to the extreme becomes foolishness.

I found this good quote in the final chapters and found myself agreeing with this. The ideas in this book seem prone to exploitation by smart, calculating employees, but I think it often is better to err on the side of being too trusting than being skeptical.
The potential upside to having a great, cohesive work force/environment far outweighs the downsides and most decisions are reversible and rolling them out as a _pilot_ is a good way to experiment. Plan for and collect relevant data where possible in order to be able to tell if an experiment is successful.
