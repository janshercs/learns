# Introduction

Pretty awesome book, easy to read. Book is mainly about how to create a workplace that is enjoyed by all employees. More of a HR book than SWE one but I think it's great for everyone and anyone who is thinking of assuming a leadership position (anyone that wishes to be a force multiplier and have influence beyond themselves).

# Learning points

- Nudges to encourage people; make it easy for them to do the things you want them to do.
- Always aim to collect and use data for your decision (very consistent with the way Google does things)

  > If there's data for decision making, we'll use the data; if there's only opinions, we're going to go with mine.

- Trust that everyone is doing their best and that they're trying their best to get the job done
- It's easier to recruit good performers v.s. training up poor performers to become good ones
- Performance at work follows a Pareto distribtution rather than a normal distribution; the mean will be higher than the median; strive to be the top 10% of performers doing 90% of the work! (I believe it's technically 80/20, but hey! you get the idea!)
