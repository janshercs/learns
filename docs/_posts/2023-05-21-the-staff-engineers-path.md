## Preamble

Before I begin, yes, I do profess that PERHAPS it is too early for me to be thinking about becoming a Staff Engineer, after all, I have just around 2.5 years of experience in this field so far.
However, I would like to refute that with these points (not that anyone is opposed to me reading this book).

1. It is never too early to start thinking about growth.

   - Yes, some of the advice given in the book might be inactionable now, but it is still good to know the concepts and run some hypothetical exercises through your mind, just for practice.

2. I work with senior engineers, staff engineer and managers who view issues very differently from I do.

   - These "big picture" ideas are constantly going through their minds when they are discussing/planning projects with me.
     It will serve me very well to understand their point of views.

3. Some of these advice apply to my level as well.

   - Advice like finding out how the organisation is structured, where are the "rooms where it happens"; these are all helpful in understanding why certain projects move ahead in an organisation while some don't!

### Chapter 2 - 3 Maps

- To be effective you need to know the landscape of the company
- Start with
  - Where you are in the organisation
  - Landscape to navigate in the organisation
    - What has been tried and failed
    - What are the relationship chasms that you need to avoid
  - Important achievements that the organisation is trying to chase down
    - The key concerns that are on the lips of the directors etc
- Find out how power is distributed: is it static or fluid?
- Keep track of the big picture, what the team is trying to achieve in the end
- Has the problem been solved before? Try to find precedence within/without the organisation if possible

  > Pitfalls with a bottom up approach
  >
  > Chaotic, too many engineers advocating for their own ideas, team gets pulled in different directions

#### Technical Vision

- Create and sell an idyllic picture of where all the objectives of the vision is achieved
- Should come with a technical strategy to help get everybody aligned
  - If it can be achieved quickly without a document, all the better (do not waste time on things that are not needed)
