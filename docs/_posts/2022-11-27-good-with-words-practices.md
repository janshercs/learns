# Introduction

It has been recently highlighted that I need to write better and a good resource I found is this book: [Good With Words](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43909268).
There are plenty of exercises that I need to attempt in order to gain the deliberate practise required to make me a more effective writer and this is where I will do my work.
I will write a summary of the book in a separate post.

# Exercises

## Exercise 1.1: Errors and Insights

> Think about things you have written in the past year, whether for a client, a judge, a colleague, or any other audience. What are some of the most common errors you make?
>
> Do you have trouble with commas?
>
> Do you struggle with transitions?
>
> Do you overload your sentences with unnecessary words?
>
> Are your professional emails too informal?
>
> Are your personal emails too stuffy?
>
> And how about the time you give yourself to edit: do you finish drafts when you say you will, or are you constantly missing out on chances to calmly and carefully raise the quality of your work?

### Mechanical Errors

1. I do not write with the aim to persuade.
2. My sentences are long and complicated.
3. I'm not sure when or which transition words to use.
4. I use unnecessary capitalizations.
5. Faulty sentence structures: trying to change grammatical patterns midway through a sentence.

### Process errors

1. I do not edit my drafts to improve it.
2. I do not comprehend the full purpose of my task before writing it.

## Exercise 1.2: Good Sentences

> To write good sentences, you need to read good sentences. So each week we will make sure to treat our brains to some high-quality material. You'll have a lot of choices to pick from. The only requirement is the one I mentioned in the Good Sentences video: pick your favorite sentence and write it out.

### Week 48, 2022

#### [State Facts for the New Age](https://therumpus.net/2016/09/02/rumpus-original-fiction-state-facts-for-the-new-age/)

> I shoved the monkey further back in the drawer, as if it will dry up and die.

#### [The coddling of the American Mind](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/)

#### [Boys are not defective](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/09/boys-are-not-defective/540204/)

> Disengaged boys grow up to become disillusioned men, Ridge says, left out of the progress they see around them.

> I think they see education as a way out of the confinement.

> Not just teacher quality but students' sense of safety, their study habits and the subtleties of boy and girl peer culture all converge to create a healthy ---or toxic--- brew.

#### [What's Better?](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/09/01/whats-better/)

> Both adults and children may go to pubs, but only children can go to school.

(note: I feel like I do not appreciate the entire poem enough; perhaps I am missing some historical context. The author is Anton Chekhov who is Russian.)

#### [Mr. Burley](https://therumpus.net/2022/11/28/rumpus-original-fiction-mr-burley/)

### Week 49, 2022

## Exercise 2.1: Headlining

Find a headline in the news that involves 2 parties and try to imagine what headlines would the local news put out on the same event.

### Practice 1:

Original headline

> Iran eliminated from World Cup after narrow defeat by the US

Iranian News

> Almost there, but not quite: Iran out of the World Cup after narrow defeat by the US.

US News

> Team USA defeats Iran in World Cup, heads to final 16.

### Practice 2:

Original headline

> Chinese authorities seek out COVID-19 protesters

Chinese News

> Authorities pursue disruptors of peace.

Foreign News

> Chinese authorities prosecutes COVID-19 protesters.
