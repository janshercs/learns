# Introduction

It has been recently highlighted that I need to write better and a good resource I found is this book: [Good With Words](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43909268).
There are plenty of exercises that I need to attempt in order to gain the deliberate practise required to make me a more effective writer and this is where I will do my work.
I will write a summary of the book in a separate post.

# Exercises

## Exercise 1.1: Errors and Insights

> Think about things you have written in the past year, whether for a client, a judge, a colleague, or any other audience. What are some of the most common errors you make?
>
> Do you have trouble with commas?
>
> Do you struggle with transitions?
>
> Do you overload your sentences with unnecessary words?
>
> Are your professional emails too informal?
>
> Are your personal emails too stuffy?
>
> And how about the time you give yourself to edit: do you finish drafts when you say you will, or are you constantly missing out on chances to calmly and carefully raise the quality of your work?

### Mechanical Errors

1. I do not write with the aim to persuade.
2. My sentences are long and complicated.
3. I'm not sure when or which transition words to use.
4. I use unnecessary capitalizations.
5. Faulty sentence structures: trying to change grammatical patterns midway through a sentence.

### Process errors

1. I do not edit my drafts to improve it.
2. I do not comprehend the full purpose of my task before writing it.

## Exercise 1.2: Good Sentences

> To write good sentences, you need to read good sentences. So each week we will make sure to treat our brains to some high-quality material. You'll have a lot of choices to pick from. The only requirement is the one I mentioned in the Good Sentences video: pick your favorite sentence and write it out.

### Week 48, 2022

#### [State Facts for the New Age](https://therumpus.net/2016/09/02/rumpus-original-fiction-state-facts-for-the-new-age/)

> Not just teacher quality but students' sense of safety, their study habits and the subtleties of boy and girl peer culture all converge to create a healthy ---or toxic--- brew.

> Outside, the barking of the dog was still rolling in the air and it matched my heartbeat perfectly.

> All I could think of was a vivid image of my mother's face, her eyes closed against the sunlight, against the life that she'd lived, her face empty of the pain as she lay with her head in a place very similar to this one, this room with its bathtub and its stained glass shower curtain and its tiles that still smelled of bleach.

## Exercise 2.1: Headlining

Find a headline in the news that involves 2 parties and try to imagine what headlines would the local news put out on the same event.

### Practice 1:

Original headline

> Iran eliminated from World Cup after narrow defeat by the US

Iranian News

> Almost there, but not quite: Iran out of the World Cup after narrow defeat by the US.

US News

> Team USA defeats Iran in World Cup, heads to final 16.

### Practice 2:

Original headline

> Chinese authorities seek out COVID-19 protesters

Chinese News

> Authorities pursue disruptors of peace.

Foreign News

> Chinese authorities prosecutes COVID-19 protesters.
