# Introduction

It has been recently highlighted that I need to write better and a good resource I found is this book: [Good With Words](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43909268).
There are plenty of exercises that I need to attempt in order to gain the deliberate practise required to make me a more effective writer and this is where I will do my work.
I will write a summary of the book in a separate post.

# Exercises

## Exercise 1.1: Errors and Insights

> Think about things you have written in the past year, whether for a client, a judge, a colleague, or any other audience. What are some of the most common errors you make?
>
> Do you have trouble with commas?
>
> Do you struggle with transitions?
>
> Do you overload your sentences with unnecessary words?
>
> Are your professional emails too informal?
>
> Are your personal emails too stuffy?
>
> And how about the time you give yourself to edit: do you finish drafts when you say you will, or are you constantly missing out on chances to calmly and carefully raise the quality of your work?

### Mechanical Errors

1. I do not write with the aim to persuade.
2. My sentences are long and complicated.
3. I'm not sure when or which transition words to use.
4. I use unnecessary capitalizations.
5. Faulty sentence structures: trying to change grammatical patterns midway through a sentence.

### Process errors

1. I do not edit my drafts to improve it.
2. I do not comprehend the full purpose of my task before writing it.

## Exercise 1.2: Good Sentences

> To write good sentences, you need to read good sentences. So each week we will make sure to treat our brains to some high-quality material. You'll have a lot of choices to pick from. The only requirement is the one I mentioned in the Good Sentences video: pick your favorite sentence and write it out.

> I shoved the monkey further back in the drawer, as if it will dry up and die.

#### [The coddling of the American Mind](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/)

> Some recent campus actions border on the surreal.

> For millennia, philosophers have understood that we don't see life as it is; we see a version distorted by our hopes, fears, and other attachments.
