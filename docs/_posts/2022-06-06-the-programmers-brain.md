# Overview

**The Programmer's Brain** was written by *Felienne Hermans* who is an academic specializing in programming education. In this book, she goes on to explain the cognition processes in the brain when programming and how to help your brain to process information with less effort.
 
# Learnings

## What types of memories are at work?

* Short Term Memory (STM)
	* Only holds about 3-8 individual pieces of information
* Long Term Memory (LTM)
	* Stores all concepts and knowledge learnt and has to be retrieved into working memory
* Working Memory
	* Coordinates STM and LTM to process information
	
## What types of confusions are there when reading code?

* Lack of knowledge
	* i.e. not understanding syntax, keywords of a new programming language (PL)
* Lack of information (context)
	* understanding the textual meaning of the code, but lacking context and information to why the code needs to do what it does
* Lack of processing power
	* extremely complex code such that the brain runs out of working memory to process
	
## How to get better at reading code?

* Chunking
	* abstracting parts of codes into a simplified model
	* leverages on concepts or mental models that exists in the LTM such as design patterns
* Tips to reduce cognitive load
	* cognitive refactoring
		* inlining code so that it reads more fluently
	* dependency graph
	* state tables

* Understanding systems and code base
	* Building text knowledge
	* Find entry point
	* Expand knowledge from focal point
	* Understand service from related entities
	* Understand how services interact with each other
	* Reconcile with plan knowledge

## How to get better at learning things?

First we need to understand how do our brains store memories:

It's via synaptic connections in a schemata where memories are linked together via relationships
