# Introduction

This book was recommended by my colleague (Sid if you're ever reading this, thanks!).
I have found this by far to be the most informative book on systems design and this includes the bunch of guides for taking on system design interviews!
The book takes an honest, ground up approach to examine the various components that may make up a system and goes into the intricacies of the widely available options for each component and the use cases they are better suited for.
