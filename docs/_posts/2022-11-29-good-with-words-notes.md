# Week 1 Notes

- Writing (and its building blocks: sentence, paragraph, phrase etc.) comprises of 2 aspects: mechanics and strategy.
  - Mechanics is the 'how'
    - It is the words used and sentence structures in a writing.
  - Strategy is the 'why'
    - It is the reason for the piece of writing.

Better mechanics enable writers to implement more advanced strategies.

The clearer the strategy/intent is behind a piece of writing, the easier to figure out the mechanics required to implement it.
