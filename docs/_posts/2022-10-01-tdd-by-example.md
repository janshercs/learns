WIP!
Introduction:
Book written by Kent Beck! How awesome!
Have not read the example about xUnit (started but not finished)

Main learnings:

- Think about the test cases first, put them all on a TODO list; do not get overwhelmed!
- You don't always have to take tiny steps; it's not a rule
  - if the code is obvious you can just write it out; as long as the test is first!
- Small steps when the right way to write the code is very helpful; technique is called triangulation
- The section about patterns is very helpful
  - Red bar patterns
  - Refactoring patterns
