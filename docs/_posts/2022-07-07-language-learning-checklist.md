# Learning New Programming Languages

There are a couple of programming languages that I would like to learn, but I feel like I keep putting them off because of

1. lack of motivation
2. lack of learning structure

So let me be my own cure and give myself a bit more structure in picking up a new programming language!

## General Structure

There are a few key pillars in programming:

- Variable assignment
- Conditionals (if else)
- Iterations (for and while)
- Classes (for object oriented languages)
  - Inheritance

I'm pretty sure I missed out somethings there but I can come back to it. While I can certainly learn these with a couple of advent of code questions, I think the most practical way of learning would be through little projects.

The most practical/important functions of program these days include:

- File system manipulation (I/O)
- Reading/Output in CLI
- HTTP calls (GET/POST)
- JSON parsing
- HTML parsing (?)
- Handling web traffic (HTTP Server)

## Learning Projects

### CLI web crawler tool

**Specifications**

- [ ] Read file containing a single URL, filename given as input on CLI
- [ ] Make network call (GET) to URL
- [ ] Parse HTML response from network call, pick out 10 anchor tags; ignoring same as self
- [ ] Output all anchor tags on .txt file

### Online web crawler server

**Specifications**

- [ ] Receive a URL from JSON POST payload
- [ ] Make network call (GET) to URL
- [ ] Parse HTML response from network call, pick out 10 anchor tags; ignoring same as self
- [ ] Output all anchor tags JSON response

## List of interested languages

- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] C
